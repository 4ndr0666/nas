## üìö **Helper Legend & Key for `[window-rules]` Module**

### üé® **1. Expo Position Grid**

Understanding workspace positions is crucial for assigning windows to specific workspaces effectively. Below is a visual representation of the Expo grid with corresponding `(X, Y)` coordinates.

```
+-----------------------+
| (0,0)   | (1,0)   | (2,0) |
|---------|---------|-------|
| (0,1)   | (1,1)   | (2,1) |
|---------|---------|-------|
| (0,2)   | (1,2)   | (2,2) |
+-----------------------+
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The grid consists of **3 columns (X-axis)** and **3 rows (Y-axis)**.
  - **(0,0)** is the **Top-Left** workspace.
  - **(1,1)** is the **Center** workspace.
  - **(2,2)** is the **Bottom-Right** workspace.

**Visual Representation:**

```
+-----------------------+
| (0,0)   | (1,0)   | (2,0) |
|---------|---------|-------|
| (0,1)   | (1,1)   | (2,1) |
|---------|---------|-------|
| (0,2)   | (1,2)   | (2,2) |
+-----------------------+
```

### üóùÔ∏è **2. Key for Special Syntax in `[window-rules]`**

## üìù **Detailed Explanation & Best Practices**

### 1. **Consolidation of Rules**

- **Before Consolidation:**
  - Multiple rules targeted the same `app_id` or `title` with individual actions.
  
  ```ini
  rule_001 = on created if app_id is "thunar" then assign workspace 0 2
  rule_002 = on created if app_id is "thunar" then snap left
  rule_003 = on created if app_id is "thunar" then set alpha 0.8
  ```

- **After Consolidation:**
  - Combined multiple actions into a single rule using the `|` operator.
  
  ```ini
  rule_001 = on created if app_id is "thunar" then assign workspace 0 2 | snap left | set alpha 0.8
  ```

**Benefits:**
- **Efficiency:** Reduces the number of rules the compositor needs to process.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and understand single rules with multiple actions.
- **Performance:** Minimizes potential conflicts and redundant processing.

### 2. **Sequential and Descriptive Rule Numbering**

- **Issue:** Non-sequential numbering can lead to confusion and difficulty in tracking rules.
  
  - **Example:**
    ```ini
    rule_005 = ...
    rule_008 = ...
    ```

- **Solution:** Maintain a sequential numbering system and group related rules together with descriptive comments.

  - **Example:**
    ```ini
    # --------------------------- #
    #          Thunar Rules
    # --------------------------- #
    rule_001 = ...
    
    # --------------------------- #
    #            MPV Rules
    # --------------------------- #
    rule_002 = ...
    ```

**Benefits:**
- **Clarity:** Easier to locate and modify specific rules.
- **Organization:** Groups related rules, enhancing readability.

### 3. **Syntax Verification and Compliance**

- **Commands Verification:** Ensure that all commands used (e.g., `set always_on_top`) are supported by Wayfire.

  - **If Unsupported:** Replace with equivalent supported commands, such as `sticky`.
  
  - **Example:**
    ```ini
    # Original
    rule_002 = on created if app_id is "mpv" then unmaximize | set always_on_top
    
    # Revised (if `set always_on_top` is unsupported)
    rule_002 = on created if app_id is "mpv" then unmaximize | sticky
    ```

- **Criteria Accuracy:** Use precise criteria to match windows effectively.

  - **Example:**
    ```ini
    # Using `app_id is` vs. `app_id contains`
    rule_008 = on created if app_id contains "vidcut" then snap right
    ```

**Benefits:**
- **Reliability:** Prevents errors during runtime due to unsupported commands.
- **Precision:** Ensures rules apply only to intended windows.

### 4. **Adding Descriptive Comments**

- **Purpose:** Enhances understanding of each rule's intent and functionality.
  
  - **Example:**
    ```ini
    # Assign Thunar to workspace (0,2), snap it to the left, and set its opacity to 0.8
    rule_001 = on created if app_id is "thunar" then assign workspace 0 2 | snap left | set alpha 0.8
    ```

**Benefits:**
- **Documentation:** Serves as inline documentation for future reference.
- **Ease of Use:** Aids in quick comprehension and troubleshooting.

### 5. **Removing Redundant or Unnecessary Rules**

- **Issue:** Redundant rules can clutter the configuration and introduce conflicts.
  
  - **Solution:** Identify and eliminate rules that duplicate actions or are no longer needed.

**Benefits:**
- **Simplicity:** Keeps the configuration lean and focused.
- **Performance:** Reduces the compositor's workload.

### 6. **Consistent Formatting and Indentation**

- **Purpose:** Improves readability and maintainability of the configuration file.
  
  - **Example:**
    ```ini
    # Consistent spacing and alignment
    rule_001 = on created if app_id is "thunar" then assign workspace 0 2 | snap left | set alpha 0.8
    ```

**Benefits:**
- **Professionalism:** Presents a well-organized and clean configuration.
- **Ease of Editing:** Simplifies manual adjustments and reviews.

   - **Thunar:**
     - Open Thunar and verify it launches in workspace (0,2), snaps to the left, and has 80% opacity.
     
   - **MPV:**
     - Launch MPV and ensure it is unmaximized and always on top.
     
   - **Alacritty:**
     - Open Alacritty and check for the specified behaviors (unmaximized, opacity, always on top).
     
   - **Other Applications:**
     - Test other rules to ensure they behave as expected.

4. **Monitor for Issues:**
   - Observe if any window rules are not functioning as intended.
   - Check Wayfire logs for any errors related to window rules.
