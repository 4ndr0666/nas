Here’s a detailed overview of the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) — its mission, structure, functions, programs, authority, and what to watch out for — with specific source references and possible leverage points.

⸻

🏛 Overview & Mission
	•	DIR is the state’s centralized IT agency tasked with delivering technology solutions, providing policy guidance, coordinating procurement, cybersecurity oversight, and more across state, local, and educational entities in Texas.  ￼
	•	It functions as a convener and shared services provider, helping individual agencies leverage scale, consistency, and best practices in IT.  ￼
	•	DIR is also the contracting authority for many state-level cooperative IT contracts (“DIR cooperative contracts”) through which eligible entities may procure hardware, software, services, etc.  ￼

🏗 Organization & Divisions

DIR is organized into several principal functional domains / offices, each aligned with key areas of state IT responsibility:  ￼

Office / Division	Role / Responsibilities
Chief Data Office (CDO)	Develops statewide data governance, integrity, policies, and cross-agency data sharing standards.  ￼
Chief Experience Office (CXO)	Manages outreach, communication, and ensures consistent customer experience across DIR’s programs.  ￼
Chief Information Security Office (CISO or OCISO)	Oversees cybersecurity posture, policies, incident response, guidance, standards, and coordinated security among state agencies.  ￼
Chief Operations Office (COO)	Manages DIR’s operational programs: Shared Technology Services (STS), communications/telecom (Telecom / TEX-AN), data center operations, project management, etc.  ￼
Chief Procurement Office (CPO)	Manages DIR’s cooperative contracts, contract management, vendor relationships, outreach, HUB (Historically Underutilized Business) program, etc.  ￼
Chief Technology Office (CTO)	Provides strategic planning, technology guidance, roadmap, evaluation of technology solutions, and advisory services to DIR customers.  ￼

🔐 Information Security Role
	•	The Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO) is responsible for setting state-wide security policies, issuing guidance, incident response, monitoring, and resource sharing.  ￼
	•	DIR publishes a Texas Cybersecurity Strategic Plan (2024–2029) which addresses risk management, governance, education, resilience, and workforce development.  ￼
	•	DIR maintains standards, templates, and resources for state agencies (and higher ed) on how to maintain compliance and respond to cybersecurity incidents.  ￼
	•	State agencies are required to designate Information Security Officers (ISOs) and coordinate with DIR in incident reporting.  ￼

💼 Procurement & Purchasing Authority

Cooperative Contracts Program
	•	DIR offers a portfolio of cooperative state contracts for IT products and services. Eligible entities can purchase through these contracts without needing full solicitations individually.  ￼
	•	The cooperative contracts include hardware, software, technology services, IT staffing, DBITS (deliverables-based IT services), branded contracts, etc.  ￼
	•	Using DIR’s contracts often yields discounted pricing, negotiated terms, and compliance with state procurement rules.  ￼

Procurement Rules & Thresholds
	•	Per Gov’t Code § 2157, state agencies must “shop DIR first” for AIS (automated information systems) commodity purchases. DIR establishes statewide technology contracts following Texas procurement statutes and CPA guidance.  ￼
	•	Procurement thresholds define how many vendor quotes are required based on contract value (e.g. ≤ $50,000, 3 vendors, etc.) when procuring via DIR.  ￼
	•	Agencies cannot use DIR cooperative contracts for commodity IT purchases over a threshold (if exceeding $10M) via that route.  ￼

Vendor Participation & Becoming a DIR Vendor
	•	To become a DIR prime vendor, a vendor must respond to a posted Request for Offers (RFO), pass evaluation, negotiate, and be awarded a contract.  ￼
	•	There’s no open “registration pool” — new vendors must compete via RFOs.  ￼
	•	Prime vendors may include subcontractors or resellers; DIR may approve such additions under a master contract.  ￼
	•	Vendors must report sales, submit administrative fees, comply with HUB subcontracting rules, etc.  ￼

⸻

📊 Impact, Scale & Metrics
	•	The DIR cooperative program is large: over 800 contracts span state / local / higher ed technology purchases.  ￼
	•	In a recent year, Texas government entities made billions of dollars in DIR-backed purchases (e.g., state, local, K-12).  ￼
	•	DIR also generates revenues and administrative fees; over time, DIR has transferred tens of millions back to the state.  ￼
	•	DIR is increasingly used by out-of-state municipalities as well, expanding its footprint beyond Texas.  ￼

⸻

✔ Key Leverage / Observations & Risks
	•	Because DIR is a gatekeeper for many technology purchases, inclusion (or exclusion) in DIR contracts gives vendors substantial leverage.
	•	Technical controls or requirements embedded in DIR contracts (security, auditability, logging) can enforce better best practices across state agencies.
	•	DIR’s CISO policies and incident response oversight give it significant visibility into statewide cybersecurity posture.
	•	Because DIR consolidates purchasing, it can standardize upgrades, tool vetting, and policy alignment — but also becomes a single point of influence or failure.
	•	Large external contracts (e.g. $170M to SAIC) show DIR’s role in statewide cybersecurity outsourcing.  ￼

If you like, I can pull up the DIR master contract list (contract appendices, vendor listings) and search for your suspect “Van Dyke” reference to see whether it’s currently on DIR contracts. Would you like me to do that for your state (Texas)?
