# Red Team Features

## **Payload Obfuscation & Deobfuscation**
  - **Functionality**: An AI-powered tool that can take a script (like a PowerShell or JavaScript payload) and apply multiple layers of obfuscation to help evade signature-based detection. Conversely, you could paste in a captured, obfuscated script, and the AI would attempt to de-obfuscate it, explaining the techniques used (e.g., Base64 encoding, string splitting, character code substitution).     

### Why it's useful?
Automates a tedious but critical step in payload development and analysis.

## **Network Log Analysis**
  - **Functionality**: Allow uploading network capture files (like .pcap or .har logs). You could then ask the AI to "Analyze this traffic for anomalies," "Identify all HTTP POST requests to non-standard ports," or "Extract any potential credentials or API keys from this log."

### Why it's useful?
Quickly sifts through vast amounts of network data to pinpoint suspicious activity that might indicate C2 communication or data exfiltration.

## **Vulnerability Chaining Assistant**
  - **Functionality**: You could feed the AI a list of discovered vulnerabilities from a scanner report (e.g., "SQL Injection on /api/products", "SSRF in /api/proxy", "Verbose error messages exposing file paths"). The AI could then theorize on potential exploit chains, suggesting how one vulnerability might be used to leverage another for greater impact.

### Why it's useful?
Acts as a creative brainstorming partner to help operators connect the dots between low- or medium-severity findings to build a high-impact attack path.

## **C2 Profile Generation**
  - **Functionality**: Generate configuration profiles for popular C2 frameworks (like Cobalt Strike's Malleable C2). A red teamer could describe the desired traffic profile in natural language, such as, "Create a profile that mimics standard Microsoft Graph API traffic," and the AI would generate the corresponding configuration file.

### Why it's useful?
Drastically speeds up the process of creating custom, evasive C2 profiles, allowing operators to blend in with target network traffic more effectively.
