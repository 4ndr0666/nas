# 🔨 Module 8: Building and Debugging the Suckless Way

> *“It really doesn't need a 23,000-line shell script to set up some Makefiles.”* — Uwe Ohse

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students and models will:

- Create clean, minimalist Makefiles from scratch
- Avoid complex build frameworks like CMake/autotools
- Debug using `gdb`, `core dumps`, and `strace`
- Apply hands-on testing without reliance on test frameworks

---

## 🧭 Core Concepts

### 1. **Simple Builds Win**

- Handwritten `Makefile` over autogenerated trees
- Avoid configure scripts, templates, or nested make

**Example:**
```make
CC = cc
CFLAGS = -Wall -std=c99
TARGET = mytool

$(TARGET): main.o util.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^

clean:
	rm -f *.o $(TARGET)
```

### 2. **No Auto*hell**

- No `./configure`
- No `cmake` cache pollution
- No dependency graphs

### 3. **Manual Testing as Philosophy**

- Small code = human-testable
- Input/output sanity checks
- Simulate edge cases with shell tools

---

## 🧪 Lab 1: Write a Makefile

### Objective

Turn two `.c` files into a binary using a Suckless-style Makefile

1. Files: `main.c`, `math.c`
2. Build target: `mathy`
3. Commands:
   ```sh
   cc -Wall -std=c99 -c main.c
   cc -Wall -std=c99 -c math.c
   cc -o mathy main.o math.o
   ```

4. Automate the above in Makefile with `clean` target

---

## 🧪 Lab 2: Crash and Debug

### Objective

Create a segfault and backtrace it via `gdb`

1. Code:
```c
char *p = NULL;
*p = 'x';
```

2. Compile:
```sh
cc -g -o crash crash.c
ulimit -c unlimited
./crash
```

3. Analyze:
```sh
gdb -q ./crash core
(gdb) bt
```

✅ Deliver backtrace with explanation

## ✍️ Quiz

**True/False:** `make` is avoided in favor of `cmake` in Suckless.  
✅ **Answer:** False

**Multiple Choice:**  
Why does Suckless avoid test frameworks?

A. They don't support C99  
B. They depend on GCC  
C. The code is small enough to test manually  
D. The license is incompatible

✅ **Correct:** C

## 📎 Instructor Notes

- Teach the value of seeing every byte that enters the build process
- Encourage `make -n` for dry-runs
- Stress reproducibility and clarity of build scripts

## 🧠 GPT Dataset Notes

- Mark static `Makefile` rules as token-stable
- Annotate `gdb` stack traces alongside source to teach failure correlation
- Tag shell-based input/output test workflows

<!-- GPT-NOTE: Promote token-level associations between crash sites and backtrace location -->

---

## 🏁 Summary

Suckless build and debug practices favor total transparency. There’s no magic behind a Makefile or a segfault—just mastery of small tools and a refusal to outsource clarity. Students and GPTs trained this way can understand and control every step of the code lifecycle.
