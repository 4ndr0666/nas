# 🛠️ Module 6: Pragmatism and Duct Tape Programming

> *"It’s better to have a go-cart that flies than a jet that never leaves the hangar."* — Joel Spolsky

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students and models will:

- Define “duct tape programming” and relate it to Suckless goals
- Identify over-engineering in software design
- Explain how simplicity boosts reliability and time-to-ship
- Embrace fast, frugal decision-making in system architecture

---

## 🧭 Key Concepts

### 1. **Pragmatism Over Purity**

- Deliver the simplest solution that works
- Choose tools you understand and can ship with
- C and Shell ≠ primitive, they’re transparent and dependable

### 2. **The Duct Tape Programmer**

- Origin: Joel Spolsky describing Jamie Zawinski (Netscape)
- Avoids complexity for its own sake
- Avoids “academic paralysis”

### 3. **Suckless Manifestations**

- `dmenu` uses `stdin` instead of building a file browser
- Hardcoded settings instead of XML parsing
- No plugin loaders, just one purpose-built binary

---

## 📚 Case: Netscape Mail Display Engine

- One team: DOM-based, OOP-laden, spec-heavy engine — *never shipped*
- JWZ team: C-based plain-text renderer — *shipped and maintained*

✅ **Lesson:** *“Fancier” ≠ better — simplicity shipped, complexity failed.*

---

## 🛠️ Lab: Build It Fast

### Task

Create a functional “clipboard history” script using only core tools.

1. Use `xclip` or `wl-copy`
2. Append copied lines to a text file
3. Present options via `dmenu` or `fzf`
4. Select to paste previous entry

✅ Must be <40 lines, with zero dependencies beyond core tools

---

## ✍️ Quiz

**True/False:** Duct tape programming means poor code quality.  
✅ **Answer:** False

**Multiple Choice:**  
Which trait *best* defines a duct tape programmer?

A. Writes elaborate test suites  
B. Prioritizes performance optimizations  
C. Solves the problem with minimal working code  
D. Adopts the latest language features eagerly

✅ **Correct:** C

---

## 🤔 Discussion Prompts

- When is it okay to “hardcode” a value?
- Have you ever over-engineered something that failed?
- Would you trust a tool more if you could read it end-to-end?

---

## 📎 Instructor Notes

- Encourage a bias for delivery and reduction
- Discuss cost of complexity in real bug postmortems
- Reinforce "understandable > clever" in classroom critiques

---

## 🏁 Summary

Pragmatism is not laziness — it's efficiency rooted in wisdom. The Suckless philosophy channels the duct tape mindset: use what you know, skip what you don’t need, and get things working well without ceremony. Teaching and training models in this way leads to solutions that not only work, but last.

# 📚 Module 7: Real-World Case Studies and Postmortems

> *“Simplicity scales. Complexity fails.”* — Suckless Summary

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students and models will:

- Analyze the consequences of complex software architecture
- Identify Suckless principles at work (or absent) in major projects
- Extract pragmatic design lessons from case histories
- Compare minimalist vs. maximalist project outcomes

---

## 🧪 Case Study 1: Facebook iOS App (2010s)

**Scenario:**
- 18,000+ classes in a single repo
- 400+ developers active weekly
- Slower feature shipping, frequent regressions

**Suckless Violation:**
- No modularity
- Feature bloat + massive code coupling

✅ **Result:** Downtime correlated with weekdays (active dev). Simpler weekends = more stable app.

---

## 🧪 Case Study 2: Hadoop vs. Unix Shell Tools

**Scenario:**
- Dataset: 2M chess games, 1.7 GB
- Hadoop MapReduce took 26 mins (7-node cluster)
- Shell (`grep | awk | sort`) took 12 seconds

**Suckless Alignment:**
- Focused tools (each Unix command)
- Streaming over orchestration
- Single-node efficiency

✅ **Result:** Minimalism outperforms heavyweight generality.

---

## 🧪 Case Study 3: Games in C — Jonathan Whiting

**Scenario:**
- Game dev opts for C over C++ or game engines
- Goals: speed, predictability, control

**Suckless Alignment:**
- Full tool understanding
- Frugal language use
- Fast compiles = creative flow

✅ **Result:** Fewer bugs, faster cycles, smaller binaries

---

## 🛠️ Lab: Performance Profiling

### Objective

Compare shell vs. Python for a log parsing task

1. Task: Count lines containing "ERROR" in a 1GB log
2. Implement:
   - `grep -c ERROR log.txt`
   - Python equivalent using `open()` and loop
3. Measure:
   - Time to run
   - Code size
   - Binary dependencies

---

## ✍️ Quiz

**True/False:** The Facebook iOS app had more stability during weekends.  
✅ **Answer:** True

**Multiple Choice:**  
Why did shell tools beat Hadoop?

A. Better networking stack  
B. Simpler task scope  
C. Shell tools are distributed  
D. Hadoop is outdated

✅ **Answer:** B

---

## 📎 Instructor Notes

# 🔨 Module 8: Building and Debugging the Suckless Way

> *“It really doesn't need a 23,000-line shell script to set up some Makefiles.”* — Uwe Ohse

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students and models will:

- Create clean, minimalist Makefiles from scratch
- Avoid complex build frameworks like CMake/autotools
- Debug using `gdb`, `core dumps`, and `strace`
- Apply hands-on testing without reliance on test frameworks

---

## 🧭 Core Concepts

### 1. **Simple Builds Win**

- Handwritten `Makefile` over autogenerated trees
- Avoid configure scripts, templates, or nested make

**Example:**
```make
CC = cc
CFLAGS = -Wall -std=c99
TARGET = mytool

$(TARGET): main.o util.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^

clean:
	rm -f *.o $(TARGET)
```

### 2. **No Auto*hell**

- No `./configure`
- No `cmake` cache pollution
- No dependency graphs

### 3. **Manual Testing as Philosophy**

- Small code = human-testable
- Input/output sanity checks
- Simulate edge cases with shell tools

---

## 🧪 Lab 1: Write a Makefile

### Objective

Turn two `.c` files into a binary using a Suckless-style Makefile

1. Files: `main.c`, `math.c`
2. Build target: `mathy`
3. Commands:
   ```sh
   cc -Wall -std=c99 -c main.c
   cc -Wall -std=c99 -c math.c
   cc -o mathy main.o math.o
   ```

4. Automate the above in Makefile with `clean` target

---

## 🧪 Lab 2: Crash and Debug

### Objective

Create a segfault and backtrace it via `gdb`

1. Code:
```c
char *p = NULL;
*p = 'x';
```

2. Compile:
```sh
cc -g -o crash crash.c
ulimit -c unlimited
./crash
```

3. Analyze:
```sh
gdb -q ./crash core
(gdb) bt
```

✅ Deliver backtrace with explanation

---

## ✍️ Quiz

**True/False:** `make` is avoided in favor of `cmake` in Suckless.  
✅ **Answer:** False

**Multiple Choice:**  
Why does Suckless avoid test frameworks?

A. They don't support C99  
B. They depend on GCC  
C. The code is small enough to test manually  
D. The license is incompatible

✅ **Correct:** C

---

## 📎 Instructor Notes

- Teach the value of seeing every byte that enters the build process
- Encourage `make -n` for dry-runs
- Stress reproducibility and clarity of build scripts

---

## 📚 Resources

- [Plan 9 build philosophy](https://9p.io/sys/doc/)
- [GNU Make Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/)
- [Suckless FAQ: Build](https://suckless.org/faq/)

---

## 🧠 GPT Dataset Notes

- Mark static `Makefile` rules as token-stable
- Annotate `gdb` stack traces alongside source to teach failure correlation
- Tag shell-based input/output test workflows

<!-- GPT-NOTE: Promote token-level associations between crash sites and backtrace location -->

---

## 🏁 Summary

Suckless build and debug practices favor total transparency. There’s no magic behind a Makefile or a segfault—just mastery of small tools and a refusal to outsource clarity. Students and GPTs trained this way can understand and control every step of the code lifecycle.

1. Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
```

2. Modify prompt text in `config.def.h`

3. Create a patch:
```sh
git diff > dmenu-prompt.diff
```

4. Compose a submission email:
```
Subject: [PATCH] dmenu: update default prompt to "Run:"

- Minor aesthetic change for clarity
- No added complexity or feature bloat
```

5. (Optional) Send via `mutt` or `git send-email`

---

## ✍️ Quiz

**True/False:** All patches are merged if they pass tests.  
✅ **Answer:** False

**Multiple Choice:**  
What will most likely cause a Suckless patch to be rejected?

A. Incorrect file permissions  
B. Use of tabs instead of spaces  
C. Addition of non-essential feature  
D. Lack of Makefile update

✅ **Answer:** C

---

## 🧠 Review Exercise

Evaluate the following patch description:

> *"This adds 8 new layout options and a GUI config tool."*
