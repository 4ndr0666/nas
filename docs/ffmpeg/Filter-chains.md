### 1. **High-Quality Scaling (if needed)**
If you ever need to scale your videos, using a high-quality scaling algorithm can make a difference in preserving
detail. For instance, the `lanczos` scaling method is often recommended for its balance between quality and
performance:

```bash
-vf "scale=-1:1080:flags=lanczos"
```
This example scales the video to a height of 1080 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio. The `lanczos` filter
is particularly good for downscaling.

### 2. **Denoising**
If your source footage is noisy, which can be more noticeable after processing like interpolation, applying a
denoising filter might improve the visual quality. The `nlmeans` or `hqnrdn3d` filters can be used for this purpose:

```bash
-vf "nlmeans=3:3:7:5"
```
or
```bash
-vf "hqnrdn3d=2:1:2:3"
```
These settings should be tweaked based on the noise level and desired output quality.

### 3. **HDR to SDR Conversion**
If you're working with HDR content and need to convert it to SDR for broader compatibility, ffmpeg can handle tone
mapping:

```bash
-vf "zscale=t=linear:npl=100, format=gbrpf32le,
zscale=p=bt709,tonemap=tonemap=hable,zscale=t=bt709:m=bt709:r=tv,format=yuv420p"
```
This complex filter chain converts HDR to SDR using the Hable tone-mapping method.

### 4. **Frame Blending for Smoothness**
In addition to or instead of motion-compensated interpolation, frame blending can sometimes create smoother
slow-motion effects, especially in footage with less clear motion vectors:

```bash
-vf "minterpolate=fps=240, tblend=all_mode=average,framestep=2"
```
This blends frames together to smooth out transitions but can result in a more "ghostly" appearance, which may or
may not be desirable depending on the content.

### 5. **Color Correction**
Adjusting color settings directly within ffmpeg can help correct or enhance footage without needing separate color
grading software:

```bash
-vf "curves=preset=cross_process"
```
or
```bash
-vf "eq=contrast=1.5:brightness=0.05:saturation=1.2"
```
These filters adjust curves and basic color settings, respectively.
