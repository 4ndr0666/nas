# Energy Blurbs

The following is a spat of "blurbs" that were spawned in my thought processes as I read your response in no particular order and will by properly fleshed out in the text proceeding them:

1. "Earths natural plasma flow"
2. Magnetosphere, ionosphere and telluric
3. "self-organizing structures" -- consciousness-enhancing properties
4. "ether" 
5. "prana"
6. Angle of pyramid similar to toroidal energy field.
7. Consciousness-altering energy zone.
8. Harmony
9. Resonance
10. zero-point
11. electrogravitic
12. toroidal fusion reactors create stable self-sustaining plasma fields
