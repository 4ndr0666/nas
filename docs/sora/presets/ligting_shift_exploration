From a full-body portrait image, animate a smooth, behind-the-scenes video shot with a stabilizer. The woman in a black shirt with no support is wearing a fading expression from curiosity to an unpleasant expression on her face. Suggesting a putrid taste. She is not happy. her mouth is wide open to reveal a collection of milky translucent viscus liquid. it seems her tongue is slathered in the viscus liquid as well, her tongue rolls to handle the substance without dribbling it.
Environment: All other items remain static and as-is in the original scene. Character remains consistent and as original without mutation, alteration or disfigurement.]
