# Photography Prompts (Sora)

## 1. Simulated Depth of Field Pull

**Prompt**: Starting from this studio portrait, generate a video where the camera subtly racks focus between the model’s eyes, lips, and background, simulating a professional photographer adjusting aperture during a beauty shoot.  

**Lighting**: Studio strobe, soft shadows.  

**Lens**: 85mm f/1.4.

## 2. Lighting Shift Exploration

**Prompt**: Animate this editorial photo to explore lighting styles: smoothly transition from Rembrandt lighting to butterfly lighting, with visible softbox movement and changing facial shadow contours, as in a real light test.  

**Camera**: Tripod, locked frame.

---

## 3. Studio-to-Location Match Cut

**Prompt**: Create a short video from a single image where the background and ambient light morphs from high-key studio to natural window light, maintaining the model’s pose and expression—demonstrating a location scout simulation.  

**Lens**: 50mm, constant framing.

---

## 4. Multi-Pose Morph Sequence

**Prompt**: Using one fashion image, interpolate a sequence where the model shifts through three classic poses, as if directed by a photographer on set.  

**Lighting**: Beauty dish with slight rim light.  

**Background**: Seamless gray.

---

## 5. Cinematic Camera Move (Arc or Dolly)

**Prompt**: From a single full-body portrait, animate a slow, smooth camera arc around the model from left to right, as if shooting a behind-the-scenes video with a gimbal.  

**Lighting**: Edge-lit, low fill.  

**Lens**: 35mm.

---

## 6. On-Set Environmental Effects

**Prompt**: Transform this fashion shot by animating subtle wind blowing the model’s hair and fabric, and a light haze effect, simulating in-studio fan and haze machine.  

**Camera**: Fixed tripod.  

**Lighting**: Directional backlight.

---

## 7. Flash-to-Continuous Lighting Comparison

**Prompt**: Animate a seamless transition between two lighting setups: crisp flash-lit portrait morphing into a soft, continuous light mood, with the model reacting naturally as the light changes.  

**Camera**: Slight push-in.

---

## 8. Portfolio B-Roll Movement

**Prompt**: Turn this high-resolution model portrait into a short, looping B-roll: Subtle head tilt, micro-expression changes, and simulated handheld camera sway for editorial depth.  

**Lighting**: Mixed natural and fill.

---

## 9. Refined Skin/Texture Detail

**Prompt**: Animate this beauty close-up so that the camera slowly glides over the model’s face, revealing micro-details in skin, makeup, and jewelry, as with a macro video lens.  

**Lighting**: Ring light, minimal shadows.

---

## 10. Editorial Composite Expansion

**Prompt**: Extend this studio portrait by animating the crop to reveal more of the set, bringing secondary props or assistants into the frame, as if the photographer is pulling back for an editorial wide shot.  

**Camera**: Zoom-out, tripod mount.

# Photographic Workflow Integration

	•	Match real lenses, lighting, and angles for best results—describe setups as you would on set.
	•	Simulate adjustments (focus, aperture, lighting moves) to preview setups for clients or creative directors.
	•	Batch with filenames or asset tags in scripting for high-volume shoots.
	•	Review generated video for photographic accuracy: check skin tones, shadows, and motion realism.
	•	Iterate prompt wording for each set, style, or lighting approach.
	•	Store and version successful prompt templates for future campaign efficiency.
