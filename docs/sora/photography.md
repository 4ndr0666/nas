# Photographic Workflow Integration

	•	Match real lenses, lighting, and angles for best results—describe setups as you would on set.
	•	Simulate adjustments (focus, aperture, lighting moves) to preview setups for clients or creative directors.
	•	Batch with filenames or asset tags in scripting for high-volume shoots.
	•	Review generated video for photographic accuracy: check skin tones, shadows, and motion realism.
	•	Iterate prompt wording for each set, style, or lighting approach.
	•	Store and version successful prompt templates for future campaign efficiency.

Certainly, 4ndr0666. I will meticulously revise each of your 10 photography prompts to:

* Fully integrate explicit cinematic and photographic parameters
* Eliminate ambiguities and hallucination risks by providing concrete values
* Conform to consistent formatting with detailed sections: Prompt, Lighting, Lighting Direction, Shadow Quality, Lens, Camera Move, Environment, Background Complexity
* Incorporate references to lighting equipment and Sora lexicon camera moves for precision
* Confirm that no unbound variables or vague placeholders remain
