Tested @ortiza5 suggestion and it works. I installed https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-agent-switcher/kchfmpdcejfkipopnolndinkeoipnoia

But by default you only have Firefox 33, which will trigger a message from Google Docs that your browser is no longer compatible.

Go to the User Agent Switcher extension options, in the Custom User Agents tab, and add a more recent custom user agent. For example:
New User-agent name: Mac Firefox 121
New User-Agent String: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:121.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/121.0
Indicator Flag: FFM
Then click the Add button.

Stay in the extension options, go to Permanent Spoof List tab, and add the Google Docs domain:
Domain: docs.google.com
User-Agent String: Mac Firefox 121 (or the user agent you added on step 1)
Then click the Add button.

Now when you'll go open a doc at https://docs.google.com/document/ or a spreadsheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/ User Agent Switcher will trigger the Firefox user agent. But it will remain the default Chrome user agent for all other websites.

And images in Google Docs no longer show inverted colors when Dark Reader is on.
